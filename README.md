## 👋 About Me

I’m **Shubham**, a Machine Learning Engineer focused on **production-grade ML systems** that sit at the core of real products.

My work goes beyond training individual models — I design **end-to-end decision systems** where:
- multiple models interact  
- tradeoffs matter (accuracy, latency, cost, interpretability)  
- offline metrics must translate to real-world outcomes  

I work across **classical ML, deep learning, and LLM-based systems**, with a strong bias toward solutions that are **measurable, reliable, and scalable**.

## 🔭 What I Work On

- **Decision, ranking, and personalization systems** serving high-traffic products  
- **Multi-label and multi-objective prediction** (hundreds of concurrent signals)  
- **Representation learning** reused across multiple downstream tasks  
- **LLM-powered inference pipelines**
  - extracting structured signals from unstructured data  
  - augmenting traditional ML systems with language models  
- **Agentic and workflow-driven ML systems**
  - model retraining, evaluation, and control logic  
  - LLMs used for orchestration, analysis, and automation (with guardrails)  
- **Large-scale ML pipelines**
  - Spark-based training and feature generation  
  - cloud-native deployment and monitoring

## 🌱 What I’m Actively Leveling Up On

I’m preparing for **senior / staff-level ML ownership**, with a focus on:

- **Foundation & representation models**
  - shared embeddings across tasks  
  - efficient transformers and memory-aware architectures  

- **LLM systems engineering**
  - reliability, cost control, and evaluation of LLM-backed systems  
  - when to use LLMs vs classical models  

- **Agentic architectures**
  - constrained agents for orchestration and decision support  
  - observability, failure modes, and safety  

- **Evaluation & experimentation**
  - aligning offline metrics with online impact  
  - long-horizon experiments and system-level KPIs

## 🧠 How I Think About ML

- Models are components in systems, not endpoints  
- Strong baselines > clever architectures  
- Data quality and labels are first-class problems  
- If you can’t measure impact, you don’t really have a model  
- Production constraints are design inputs, not afterthoughts

## 📌 Selected Work

> Many systems I’ve worked on are private, but representative examples include:

- Large-scale decision and recommendation systems influencing user-facing outcomes  
- Multi-task models predicting hundreds of customer and product signals  
- LLM-augmented pipelines for structured signal extraction and reasoning  
- Agent-like workflows for evaluation, retraining, and system automation  
- Debugging ML systems with silent failures and misaligned metrics
